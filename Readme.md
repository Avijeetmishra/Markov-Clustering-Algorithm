Homework 3: Clustering Analysis for Complex Networks

Description:  In this homework successfully implemented the “Markov Cluster Algorithm”. This algorithm partitions the given network into clusters based on the concept of random walks which was explained earlier. The MCL algorithm was implemented on 3 networks, AT&T Web network, physics collaboration network, and yeast metabolic network. Then by visualizing the clusters formed in the network using Pajek, we observed that the number of links inside a cluster are more as compared to the number of links in between different clusters. We also analyzed the effect of parameters inflation and expansion (power) on clustering. 

To directly execute the code, go to the "Homework3\Code\Markov_Cluster_Algorithm\Markov_Cluster_Algorithm\bin\Debug\Markov_Cluster_Algorithm.exe".
